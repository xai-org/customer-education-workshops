# customer-education-workshops

This is a logical monorepo of independent workshop demos. Each top-level folder is its own app (own `package.json`, lockfile, and `.cursor/skills`). Do not share Tailwind, UI kits, or databases across demos.

When working in a demo folder, follow that folder’s `AGENTS.md` and the root `.cursor/rules` whose `globs` match it. Do not apply one demo’s catalog, seams, or skills to another.
