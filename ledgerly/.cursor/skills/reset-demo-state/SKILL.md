description: Put a Ledgerly demo machine back to the shipped state — reseed SQLite, restore the expected red test, free the port, clear stray edits, delete git branches opened for this demo beat, drop personal rules, delete the Canvas, delete Figma slides if this demo created any, and cancel the private ce-field-demos Linear board (issues + project) whenever the Linear MCP is connected. Use when a demo just ended, the data looks wrong, tests are unexpectedly green, or the dev server will not start.

# Reset the demo state

Goal state: seeded Fieldnote book, dev server on 43173, `npm test` showing exactly **1 failed / 33 passed**, no leftover personal rules from `/create-rule`, no leftover Canvas from the 101 beat, no leftover Figma Slides deck from the 101 MCP beat, no leftover git branch from the 201 `/standard-bug-fix` beat, and the private `ce-field-demos` Linear board torn down — its issues `Canceled` and the project `Canceled`, with the private team retained. Restore `lib/disputes/suggested-credit-api.ts` if a prior demo switched the client to v2. Restore `components/filter-pills.tsx` if a prior demo renamed the pill query key from `state` to `status`. Restore `app/invoices/page.tsx` and `app/disputes/page.tsx` if a prior demo made those pages read `state`.

## Checklist (run what applies)

1. **Stray edits from the last demo**

```bash
git status
git checkout -- lib/disputes/suggested-credit-api.ts   # shipped client selects v1
git checkout -- components/filter-pills.tsx            # shipped pills write state=
git checkout -- app/invoices/page.tsx app/disputes/page.tsx  # shipped pages read status=
rm -f .cursor/rules/suggested-credit-api-v2.mdc       # live /create-rule beat only
git checkout -- .                        # only if the user agrees to drop ALL local changes
```

`git checkout -- .` restores tracked files, including the shipped synthetic-dataset hook (`.cursor/hooks.json` and `.cursor/hooks/synthetic-prompt.mjs`). Leave those in place. Delete any other hook script a demo beat added under `.cursor/hooks/`.

2. **Demo-beat git branches**

`/standard-bug-fix` (201) may create a feature branch from Linear `gitBranchName`. Reset must not leave it. Switch to `main` first, then delete every local branch opened for this demo beat (the Linear issue `gitBranchName`, `/standard-bug-fix` work, filter-pills / suggested-credit / email-on-invoice branches). If that branch was pushed, delete the remote too.

```bash
git checkout main
git branch -D <linear-gitBranchName>
git push origin --delete <linear-gitBranchName>
```

`<linear-gitBranchName>` is the branch `/standard-bug-fix` created this session (Linear's `gitBranchName` on the issue). List local branches (`git branch`) and delete only the ones created for the Linear cards — not `main` / `master`, and not the operator's unrelated work. Never `--force` push. Report the branches you deleted.

3. **Personal rules**

List user rules, then remove every one. Demo `/create-rule` leftovers must not survive a reset.

Use `cursor_dialog` in the `cursor-app-control` namespace (`item: "rule"`, `scope: "user"`):

1. `action: "list"`
2. For each returned `id`, `action: "remove"` with that `id`

If the list is empty, skip. Report titles you removed. Do not recreate them.

4. **Delete the Canvas**

Canvases from the 101 beat live outside the repo. Grok Build only picks up files in `~/.cursor/projects/<workspace-slug>/canvases/`. The slug is the absolute repo path with `/` replaced by `-` (example: `~/.cursor/projects/Users-operator-ce-field-demos/canvases/`).

Delete leftover canvas artifacts:

```bash
REPO="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
SLUG="${REPO#/}"
SLUG="${SLUG//\//-}"
CANVASES="$HOME/.cursor/projects/${SLUG}/canvases"
ls -1 "$CANVASES"/*.canvas.tsx "$CANVASES"/*.canvas.data.json 2>/dev/null
rm -f "$CANVASES"/*.canvas.tsx "$CANVASES"/*.canvas.data.json
```

Report the filenames you removed. If none exist, skip. Do not delete `tsconfig.json`, `node_modules/`, or the `canvases/` directory itself.

5. **Figma slides (only if this demo created a deck)**

If the conversation created a Figma Slides file (101 MCP beat; URL like `https://www.figma.com/slides/<fileKey>`), delete its slides.

There is no file-delete tool on the Figma MCP. Load `figma-use` and `figma-use-slides`, then `use_figma` on that `fileKey`:

```js
const grid = figma.getSlideGrid();
for (const row of grid) {
  for (const slide of [...row]) {
    slide.remove();
  }
}
return { remaining: figma.getSlideGrid().flat().length };
```

Expect `remaining: 0`. If no Slides URL or fileKey appears in this session, skip. Do not hunt other teams' files.

6. **Linear board (whenever the Linear MCP is connected)**

Offer to tear down the `ce-field-demos` board any time the Linear MCP is connected — not only when this session staged it. Skip only if the MCP is missing, auth fails, or no private team can be confirmed. Linear MCP has no issue- or project-delete tool, so "clean" means cancel, not delete.

**Confirm the target private team (same gate as `stage-linear`).** Authenticate Linear (`mcp_auth` if gated). `get_user` with `"me"` — `isGuest` must be false. Build the candidate list of **private** teams on `me`, present each with its name, key, and settings URL (`https://linear.app/<workspace>/settings/teams/<KEY>`), then confirm exactly one before any write. Never guess: a non-interactive run must be given an explicit team name or ID; if it is missing or more than one candidate matches, stop and print the candidates. Never mutate a public or shared team.

`list_projects` with query `ce-field-demos`. Act **only** on a project whose `teams` are exactly the confirmed private team, `lead` is the operator (`me`), and name is `ce-field-demos` or `ce-field-demos (…)`. If several match, list them and confirm which to tear down. Do not touch another team's issues.

For each matched project:

- `list_issues` on it. For every issue (catalog titles from `FIELD_DEMO_ISSUES` and `COLLECTIONS_COMMAND_CENTER_ISSUES` in `lib/runbooks/linear-field-demos.ts`, plus any leftover filler), `save_issue`:
  - `id`: the issue identifier
  - `state`: `Canceled`

  Do **not** set `project: null`. Leave the issue linked to the project. Canceling the project does not cancel its issues, so the issue `state` is set to `Canceled` to clear it from the operator's "My Issues"; the unlink is unnecessary churn.
- Then close the board: `save_project` with the project `id` and `state`: `Canceled`. Verify the exact Canceled project-status string on the team the first time you run this, then use it.

Leave the private team in place — Linear MCP cannot recreate it. The next `stage-linear` reactivates this project (sets it back to `Backlog`) and reopens the three Fieldnote issues and the nine Collections Command Center slices by title. Do not unarchive an issue; archived catalog titles are recreated by `stage-linear`.

If no matching project exists on the confirmed team, skip. Report the confirmed team, the canceled project name + URL, and the issue identifiers/titles you canceled. Do not hunt other workspaces.

7. **Database looks wrong / empty dashboard**

```bash
npx prisma db seed        # idempotent: pushes schema + reloads Fieldnote
# nuclear option if the file is corrupt:
npm run db:reset
```

There are no migrations in this repo — never run `prisma migrate`; the seed's `db push` is the whole story.

8. **Port 43173 busy**

```bash
lsof -ti :43173 | xargs kill   # macOS/Linux/WSL
npm run dev
```

9. **Verify shipped state**

```bash
npm test    # expect: 1 failed (suggested-credit-api), 33 passed
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:43173` — dashboard shows Fieldnote data, catalog $49/$99/$249, disputes badge on the sidebar.

Open `http://127.0.0.1:43173/disputes/dsp_1043` — the Resolution panel shows a red **Suggested credit $400.00** from v1 above the $249 Scale price. Confirm `/api/v2/disputes/dsp_1043/suggested-credit` returns $249.00. If the page reads $249.00 from v2, restore `lib/disputes/suggested-credit-api.ts`.

## Never

- Never delete `prisma/seed.ts` data or add customers to "fix" a demo.
- Never edit `tests/suggested-credit-api.test.ts`, either API route, or the seed to make the shipped red test green.
- Never leave `.cursor/rules/suggested-credit-api-v2.mdc` in the shipped tree; create and remove it during the live rule beat.
- Never leave personal `/create-rule` leftovers, a leftover Canvas, a demo Slides deck, a leftover `/standard-bug-fix` git branch, or a live `ce-field-demos` Linear board after reset when the Linear MCP is connected.
- Never cancel Linear issues on a public or shared team. Never delete the operator’s private team.
- The shipped synthetic-dataset hook stays: `.cursor/hooks.json` and `.cursor/hooks/synthetic-prompt.mjs`. Delete any other hook a demo beat added.
